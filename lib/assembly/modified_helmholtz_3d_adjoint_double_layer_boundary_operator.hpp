/** \ingroup modified_helmholtz_3d
 *  \brief Construct a BoundaryOperator object representing the adjoint
 *  double-layer boundary operator associated with the modified Helmholtz
 *  equation in 3D.
 *
 *  \param[in] context
 *    A Context object that will be used to build the weak form of the
 *    boundary operator when necessary.
 *  \param[in] domain
 *    Function space being the domain of the boundary operator.
 *  \param[in] range
 *    Function space being the range of the boundary operator.
 *  \param[in] dualToRange
 *    Function space dual to the the range of the boundary operator.
 *  \param[in] waveNumber
 *    Wave number. See \ref modified_helmholtz_3d for its definition.
 *  \param[in] label
 *    Textual label of the operator. If empty, a unique label is generated
 *    automatically.
 *  \param[in] symmetry
 *    Symmetry of the weak form of the operator. Can be any combination of the
 *    flags defined in the enumeration type Symmetry.
 *  \param[in] useInterpolation
 *    If set to \p false (default), the standard exp() function will be used to
 *    evaluate the exponential factor occurring in the kernel. If set to \p
 *    true, the exponential factor will be evaluated by piecewise-cubic
 *    interpolation of values calculated in advance on a regular grid. This
 *    normally speeds up calculations, but might result in a loss of accuracy.
 *    This is an experimental feature: use it at your own risk.
 *  \param[in] interpPtsPerWavelength
 *    If \p useInterpolation is set to \p true, this parameter determines the
 *    number of points per "effective wavelength" (defined as \f$2\pi/|k|\f$,
 *    where \f$k\f$ = \p waveNumber) used to construct the interpolation grid.
 *    The default value (5000) is normally enough to reduce the relative or
 *    absolute error, *whichever is smaller*, below 100 * machine precision. If
 *    \p useInterpolation is set to \p false, this parameter is ignored.
 *
 *  None of the shared pointers may be null and the spaces \p range and \p
 *  dualToRange must be defined on the same grid, otherwise an exception is
 *  thrown.
 *
 *  If local-mode ACA assembly is requested (see AcaOptions::mode), after
 *  discretization, the weak form of this operator is stored as the product
 *
 *  \f[
 *     P A_{\textrm{d}} Q,
 *  \f]
 *
 *  where \f$A_{\textrm{d}}\f$ is the weak form of this operator discretized
 *  with test and trial functions being the restrictions of the basis functions
 *  of \p domain and \p range to individual elements; \f$Q\f$ is the sparse
 *  matrix representing the expansion of the basis functions of \p domain in the
 *  just mentioned single-element trial functions; and \f$P\f$ is the sparse
 *  matrix whose transpose represents the expansion of the basis functions of \p
 *  dualToRange in the single-element test functions.
 *
 *  \tparam BasisFunctionType
 *    Type of the values of the basis functions into
 *    which functions acted upon by the operator are expanded.
 *  \tparam KernelType
 *    Type of the values of the kernel functions occurring
 *    in the integrand of the operator.
 *  \tparam ResultType
 *    Type used to represent elements of the weak form form of the operator.
 *
 *  The latter three template parameters can take the following values: \c
 *  float, \c double, <tt>std::complex<float></tt> and
 *  <tt>std::complex<double></tt>. All types must have the same precision: for
 *  instance, mixing \c float with <tt>std::complex<double></tt> is not
 *  allowed. The parameter \p ResultType is by default set to "larger" of \p
 *  BasisFunctionType and \p KernelType, e.g. for \p BasisFunctionType = \c
 *  double and \p KernelType = <tt>std::complex<double></tt> it is set to
 *  <tt>std::complex<double></tt>. You should override that only if you set
 *  both \p BasisFunctionType and \p KernelType to a real type, but you want
 *  the entries of the operator's weak form to be stored as complex numbers.
 *
 *  Note that setting \p KernelType to a real type implies that the wave number
 *  must also be chosen purely real.
